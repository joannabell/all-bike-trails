After railroad operations ceased in the late 1960s, many ideas were considered for the corridor. The late Senator William C. O'Neill was instrumental in advocating for the railroad's re-use as a bike path to make it safer for children to ride a bike to school.",

The greatest elevation change is on the Trestle Trail segment. For more than half its length, the path runs parallel to the Pawtuxet River. Small boat access is possible at several points with formal canoe launches. The trail also features an equestrian trail now open from Route 117 at Old Main Street to Log Bridge Road. The equestrian path sometimes shares the bikeway, sometimes goes off path both north and south of the bikeway.",
